## Projects Developed primarily using LSTM in jupyter notebooks on kaggle.

**<h3>Project 1</h3>** A simple sequence prediction task to predict the (n+1)th natural number given a sequence of n natural numbers. This covers the basics of LSTM including understanding the expected input shape((batch_size, seq_len, feature_number) OR (seq_len, batch_size, feature_number)) and shaping the input data accordingly , hidden dimensions of an LSTM , applying fully connected layer to the LSTM output to get the desired output in the desired shape.
